# Breast-Cancer-Prediction Using Different Algorithms.

## Problem Statement :

The problem is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify breast tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various clinical and demographic features.

**The objectives of the project are as follows:**

* **Data Collection :**  *Collect a dataset that includes relevant clinical and demographic features of breast tumors, such as tumor size, shape, texture, and patient age, along with the corresponding diagnosis (malignant or benign).*

* **Data Preprocessing :**  *Clean and preprocess the collected data by handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and normalizing or scaling the feature values as needed.*

* **Feature Selection :** *Identify the most informative and relevant features that contribute to the prediction of breast cancer.*

* **Model Development :**  *Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict breast cancer based on the selected features. Various classification algorithms can be employed, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or perception.*

* **Model Evaluation :** *Evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision.*

* **Prediction and Interpretation :** *Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict whether a given breast tumor is malignant or benign based on its features.

## Brest Cancer Prediction :

The Breast Cancer Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies breast tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various clinical and demographic features.

The Breast Cancer Prediction project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment strategiesand by leveraging machine learning techniques.

## Conclusion :

* **LogisticRegression =** 93.85

* **Random Forest =** 96.69

* **KNeighborsClassifier(KNN) =** 92.98

* **Perception =** 88.54

* **GaussianNB =** 96.25

* **Support Vector Machine(SVM) =** 99.01

**From here we can see that Support Vector Machine(SVM) shows a better performance than the others(Based on Accuracy and Precision).**

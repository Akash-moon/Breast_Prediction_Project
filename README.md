# Breast-Cancer-Prediction Using Different Algorithms.

## Problem Statement :

The problem is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify breast tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various clinical and demographic features.

**The objectives of the project are as follows:**

* **Data Collection :**  *Collect a dataset that includes relevant clinical and demographic features of breast tumors, such as tumor size, shape, texture, and patient age, along with the corresponding diagnosis (malignant or benign).*

* **Data Preprocessing :**  *Clean and preprocess the collected data by handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and normalizing or scaling the feature values as needed.*

* **Feature Selection :** *Identify the most informative and relevant features that contribute to the prediction of breast cancer.*

* **Model Development :**  *Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict breast cancer based on the selected features. Various classification algorithms can be employed, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or perception.*

* **Model Evaluation :** *Evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision.*

* **Prediction and Interpretation :** *Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict whether a given breast tumor is malignant or benign based on its features.

## Brest Cancer Prediction :

The Breast Cancer Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies breast tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various clinical and demographic features.

The Breast Cancer Prediction project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment strategiesand by leveraging machine learning techniques.

 ## Background :

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world. It account for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an X-ray or felt as a lump.
    
Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of surviver. The key challenges against it's detection is how to classify tumors into malignant(Cancer) or benign(not cancer). A tumor is considered malignant (Cancer) if the cells can grow into surrounding tissues or spread to distant areas of the body. A benign tumor does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body the way cancer can. But benign tumors can be serious if they press on vital structures such as blood vessel or nerves.
    
Machine Learning technique can dramatically improve the level of diagnosis in breast cancer. Research shows that experience physicians can detect cancer by 79% accuracy, while 91%(up to 97%) accuracy can be achieved using Machine Learning techniques.


## Conclusion :

* **LogisticRegression =** 93.85

* **Random Forest =** 96.69

* **KNeighborsClassifier(KNN) =** 92.98

* **Perception =** 88.54

* **GaussianNB =** 96.25

* **Support Vector Machine(SVM) =** 99.01

**From here we can see that Support Vector Machine(SVM) shows a better performance than the others(Based on Accuracy and Precision).**
